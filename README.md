Description
-----------

We worked to combine two publically available Maryland data sets:
* __Crime by County__ Maryland county crime rates by year. Population is given for each county. (Maryland Statistical Analysis Center, 2016)
* __Poverty Rate__ Maryland county poverty rates and margin of error for the years 2006 to 2013. Data from the US Census Bureau was used to formulate these poverty rates. (Maryland Department of Planning, 2015)

By combining on county name and year, we have created a new table and database that can allow users to directly compare county poverty rates to crime rates for the years 2006 to 2013.

What questions can be answered with this data set?
-----------
How does county poverty rate affect crime in Maryland? 

We hypothesize that a higher poverty rate increases crime rate, but is that true for all types of crime?

-----------
Initial Conclusions
-----------
* By looking at the combined dataset, we found that the poverty rate has increased for every county from 2006 to 2013. 
* Also by the first glance at the data of a few initial counties, we can see that as the rate of poverty increases, the rate of almost all types of crimes increases. Thus there exists a correlation between poverty rate and the crime rate.
* To further see what type of crimes are more affected by the poverty or what types of crimes have a stronger correlation with the rate of poverty, we performed correlation in excel. Embedded  below is a plot graph of the strongest correlation: poverty to breaking and entering. Other plot graphs and correlation coefficients are included in a table for your convenience.

| Crime per 100k | Correlation Coefficient | Graph |
|---|---|---|
|Breaking and Entering|0.59|[/graphs/poverty_to_breaking_and_entering.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylemckillop/INFM600/master/graphs/poverty_to_breaking_and_entering.png)|
|Murder|0.48| [/graphs/poverty_to_murder.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylemckillop/INFM600/master/graphs/poverty_to_murder.png) |
|Aggravated Assault|  0.43 | [/graphs/poverty_to_aggravated_assault.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylemckillop/INFM600/master/graphs/poverty_to_aggravated_assault.png)  |
|Violent Crime Rate|  0.41 | [/graphs/poverty_to_violent_crime_rate.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylemckillop/INFM600/master/graphs/poverty_to_violent_crime_rate.png)  |
|Rape| 0.40  |  [/graphs/poverty_to_rape.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylemckillop/INFM600/master/graphs/poverty_to_rape.png) |
|Overall Crime Rate| 0.36  | [/graphs/poverty_to_overall_crime_rate.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylemckillop/INFM600/master/graphs/poverty_to_overall_crime_rate.png)  |
|Property Crime Rate| 0.33  | [/graphs/poverty_to_property_crime_rate.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylemckillop/INFM600/master/graphs/poverty_to_property_crime_rate.png)  |
|Robbery| 0.31  | [/graphs/poverty_to_robbery.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylemckillop/INFM600/master/graphs/poverty_to_robbery.png)  |
|Larceny Theft | 0.23  | [/graphs/poverty_to_larceny_theft.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylemckillop/INFM600/master/graphs/poverty_to_larceny_theft.png)  |
| Motor Vehicle Theft  |  0.09 | [/graphs/poverty_to_motor_vehicle_theft.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylemckillop/INFM600/master/graphs/poverty_to_motor_vehicle_theft.png)  |

There seems to be a positive correlation for nearly all types of crime.  With breaking and entering being the strongest correlation. Motor Vehicle theft has a nearly non existent correlation.
